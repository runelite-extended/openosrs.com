#### RuneLite+ has been updated to 1.3!

## The live client is now working at a reduced functionality state.

- An update has been released. The live client is now working at a **reduced** functionality state. 
- Anything that used extended mixins is **not** working as it was. 
- **A fix for that will be out asap.** We have to rework a pretty major system to get around it but it will happen! 
- Some currently not working features: **Blackjacking, Click distance and detached cam clicking, AoEWarnings, Error Transform, and a few more.**
- **Don't anything risky on your accounts until we get some confirmation that major bugs don't exist at bossing, or while pking etc**
- **Reports of CoX crashing so disable any plugins related to it**
